### Hi there 👋

I'm Jonny, a new grad from University of Toronto who majored in Computer Science and Linguistics.

This is where I upload projects about topics I'm interested in!

- 📈 I’m currently learning about NLP models 
- 💬 Ask me about anything related to linguistics or language learning
- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him
- ♟️ Fun fact: I love to play 2-player board games ([go](https://online-go.com/player/453792/), [chess](https://www.chess.com/member/jonnyli), etc.)
